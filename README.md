# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---real-world-Sales-Data
Exploratory Data Analysis with Real-World Sales Data

Background information:

We will use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions based on 12 months' worth of sales data. 

We start by cleaning our data. 

Once we have cleaned up our data, we will tackle the following 5 high-level business questions: 

• What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month? 
• What city sold the most product?
• What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying the product?
• What products are most often sold together?
• What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer the above questions, we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods, such as: 
• Concatenating multiple CSVs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
• Adding columns
• Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
• Using the .apply() method
• Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
• Plotting bar charts and line graphs to visualize our results
• Labeling our graphs
